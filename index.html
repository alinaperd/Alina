           <h3 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: center;"> Lara is a senior high school student who dreams about being an actress. She discovered her passion in the middle of school, but her parents always wanted her to study medicine since both (her mom and dad) are doctors too. Lara thinks her only option is to study medicine because her parents believe that studying to become an actor/actress will make her a fool. They also say that she will be a shame for her family if she chooses that path.
